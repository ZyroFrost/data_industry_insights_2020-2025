Our work is funded by tens of thousands of donors who rely on our research to inform their giving. Weâve grown from directing $1.5 million in 2010 to directing nearly $400 million in 2024.

The Role
Weâre hiring a Development Coordinator to serve as the operational backbone of GiveWellâs Philanthropy team. This person will be the engine that keeps our logistics running smoothly â ensuring donors receive timely, accurate, and warm responses, and operating the systems that allow fundraisers to spend more time in front of donors. Youâll be the âfront doorâ to GiveWell for donors and prospects, managing inbound communications across our main inboxes.

In this role, youâll coordinate administrative needs across the Philanthropy team and maintain the systems and processes that support our donor relationships. Youâll work closely with fundraisers, operations partners, and other internal teams to keep workflows organized, ensure logistical needs are handled reliably, and resolve inquiries with clarity and professionalism. Youâll also help us evolve our team operations as we grow â proactively spotting bottlenecks and implementing improvements that strengthen our ability to scale high-quality donor stewardship.

This role is ideal for someone who loves bringing order to complexity, thrives on enabling the success of others, and is energized by serving as a steady operational anchor in a fast-moving, evolving environment.

Why we're hiring this role right now: As our fundraising team expands, the volume and complexity of donor interactions have outpaced the operational support we currently have in place.
